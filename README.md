# 3dCube
A 3d rotating cube made from scratch, no using 3d libs
Took me about one week of learning and one week of programming this. 
You can play with the numbers and see what it outcomes. 
I have very enjoyed making this.
3D graphics always intrested me. Hope this helps someone to understand the process and the struggle of it.

Resources I used for this project :

http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-3-matrices/#transformation-matrices
http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/
https://www.3dgep.com/understanding-the-view-matrix/
https://medium.com/swlh/understanding-3d-matrix-transforms-with-pixijs-c76da3f8bd8

and some videos that I searched about how to multiply matrices and such.
